    <p> </p>
    <p>As a developer, I also like to play around with different programming languages. I've written programs in C/C++, JAVA, and python. Please check my projects for more details. Although I'm focusing on front-end website development now, I'm also open to any kind of software development opportunities. Please feel free to contact me. </p>
